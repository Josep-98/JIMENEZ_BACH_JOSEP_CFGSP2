			<p>The third test of the Quadcross national was held in Cardo, Asturias, with the organization of the Moto Club Puch Asturias. The terrain was typical there, in a valley, something that local pilots are used to but not so much from outside. The test was done jointly with the Asturian Motocross Championship so the atmosphere in the paddock was spectacular. Fans enjoyed a pleasant day of motorcycling in Cardo. Dani Vil√† wins the victory </p>
